---

On **iOS devices**, Tripomatic Premium (both in-app purchases and subscriptions) can be shared via Family Sharing.

To enable Family Sharing for Tripomatic Premium on iOS, go to Settings on your iOS device, tap Apple ID (your name at the top), then select Family Sharing. Add family members if needed and ensure Purchase Sharing is turned on. Once enabled, Tripomatic Premium in-app purchases and subscriptions will be accessible to family members.

On **Android devices**, Tripomatic Premium cannot be shared via Family Sharing due to [Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7007852?hl=en) policies.
