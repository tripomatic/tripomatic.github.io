title: Can I use Tripomatic Premium on all my devices?
---

Yes! Tripomatic Premium works on all devices (iOS, Android, web, macOS) as long as you're signed in with the same Tripomatic account.

**To restore your purchase**, open the Premium purchase screen and tap **"Already purchased? Restore"**. Make sure you're using the same Apple ID (iOS) or Google Play account (Android) that you used for the original purchase.

If you're unable to restore your purchase, contact our support team at team@tripomatic.com with your account information and purchase receipt.
