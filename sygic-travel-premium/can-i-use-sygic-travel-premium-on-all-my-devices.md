Sygic Travel Premium works on all devices signed in with the same account.

**To restore your purchase**, go to the screen where you can purchase the Premium license, and then use the "Restore" button (iOS) or tap the three dots and then the Restore option (Android).

If you are not able to restore your purchase, please check if you are using the same Apple ID or Google Play account. In case you need more help, contact our support staff at team@travel.sygic.com with your account information and the receipt for your purchase.
