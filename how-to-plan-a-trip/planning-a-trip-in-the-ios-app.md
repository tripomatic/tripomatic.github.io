Welcome to Tripomatic! The mobile app allows you to discover places around the world and create travel itineraries. The app works the same on iOS and Android.

## Creating a Trip

1. Tap **Trip** in the bottom navigation bar
2. Tap **Create new trip** (or tap **More** > **My Trips** > **Create new trip**)
3. Describe your trip - you can type naturally like "5 days in Paris next month"
4. The AI will detect your destination and suggest dates
5. Tap **Create trip** to start planning

## Working with the Map

The map shows places you might want to visit in your destination. Tap any marker to see details about a place.

**Filter places by category:**
- Tap the search bar to see category filters (Sights, Museums, Restaurants, etc.)
- Select a category to show only those places on the map

**Add a place to your trip:**
1. Tap a place on the map to see its details
2. Tap **Add to trip**
3. Choose which day to add it to

**Save a place for later:**
- Tap the heart icon to add it to your Shortlist (places you're considering but haven't committed to)
- Or tap **Favorite** to add it to your permanent favorites

## Using the Shortlist

The Shortlist is for places you're considering but haven't added to your itinerary yet. It's perfect for deciding between options.

1. Tap **Trip** in the bottom navigation
2. Scroll down to see your Shortlist
3. Drag places from the Shortlist to a day when you're ready to add them

## Custom Places

If a place isn't in our database, you can create a custom place:

1. Long-press anywhere on the map
2. A tooltip appears with the address
3. Tap **Add to trip** or **Add to Shortlist**
4. You can edit the name and details later

## Adding Multiple Destinations

To add another destination to your trip:

1. Search for the new destination
2. Tap on it to see details
3. Tap **Add to trip** and select a day
4. If the date is outside your current trip dates, you'll be asked to extend the trip

## AI Assistant

Tap **AI** in the bottom navigation to chat with the AI assistant. You can ask questions like:
- "What are the best restaurants near the Eiffel Tower?"
- "Add a coffee break after the museum"
- "Suggest activities for a rainy day"

The AI assistant requires a Premium subscription.
