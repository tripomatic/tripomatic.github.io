Common questions about Tripomatic 26 and the migration process.

### Migration Questions

#### Why can't I see my collaborators?

Collaborators and sharing relationships are not migrated to Tripomatic 26. Your trips are transferred with all their content, but you need to re-invite anyone you previously shared trips with.

To invite collaborators again:
1. Open the trip you want to share
2. Go to trip settings or the sharing menu
3. Invite your travel companions using their email address

#### Can I go back to the old app?

Yes, the old app continues to work with your original data. However, any changes you make in Tripomatic 26 will not sync back to the old version. The migration copies your data, so both versions work independently.

#### What if I made changes in the old app after migrating?

You can re-migrate individual trips using the Migration Assistant in Settings. This will replace the trip in Tripomatic 26 with the updated version from the old app.

#### Is my Premium subscription still valid?

Yes, all purchases remain valid. Tripomatic Premium works the same way in Tripomatic 26.

### Offline Maps Questions

#### How do I download maps for my trip?

1. Open your trip
2. Look for the offline/download option in the trip menu
3. Tap to download offline maps for all destinations in the trip

#### When do offline maps expire?

Offline maps expire **30 days after your trip's end date**. This helps free up storage space on your device. If your trip doesn't have an end date, the offline maps will be kept indefinitely.

#### Can I download maps for a specific area like before?

No, offline maps are now trip-based. Instead of downloading regions, you download maps for your specific trip. This approach saves storage space because you only download what you need.

### Public Transit Questions

#### Why does transit routing need a departure time?

Tripomatic 26 uses real transit schedules to give you accurate routes. To look up the schedule, the app needs to know when you plan to travel. Set a departure time for your journey to see available transit options.

#### Why isn't public transit available in my area?

Public transit routing depends on the availability of transit data. Coverage is worldwide but varies by location. If transit data isn't available for your area, try using walking or car routes instead.

#### Can I plan a transit route for a past date?

No, public transit routing only works for future dates. The app needs to query live schedule data, which is only available for upcoming departures.

### General Questions

#### What happened to 360-degree videos?

360-degree VR videos are no longer available in Tripomatic 26.

#### Do my custom places transfer?

Custom places that are part of your trips or favorites are migrated. Standalone custom places that aren't associated with any trip or favorites list are not transferred.

#### How do I access the Migration Assistant?

Go to **Settings** in Tripomatic 26 and look for **Migration Assistant**. From there, you can migrate your account, favorites, or individual trips.
