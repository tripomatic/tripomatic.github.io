title: What's New in Tripomatic 26
---

Tripomatic 26 introduces several new features and improvements to help you plan and enjoy your trips.

### Plan Before You Commit

Save places you're considering without adding them to your itinerary. This is perfect for deciding between options - you can collect interesting places and decide later which ones to include in your trip.

### Bike and Public Transit

New routing modes have been added to help you get around:

- **Bicycle** - Get cycling routes between places in your itinerary
- **Scooter** - Perfect for exploring cities with rental scooters
- **Taxi** - Plan routes when you prefer to take a cab
- **Enhanced public transit** - See actual departure and arrival times based on transit schedules, with detailed information including line numbers, colors, platform numbers, and step-by-step directions

To use public transit routing, you need to set a departure time for your journey. The app will then show you the best routes based on actual transit schedules.

### Smart Cost Tracking

Track expenses for each activity to stay on budget effortlessly. Add costs to places in your itinerary and see your total trip budget at a glance.

### New and Updated Maps

Tripomatic 26 includes new map styles:

- **Outdoor maps** - Better detail for hiking and outdoor activities
- **Winter maps** - Including ski slopes, cable cars, and winter sports facilities

### AI Assistant

Get intelligent help planning your trips. The AI assistant can help you discover places, organize your itinerary, and answer questions about your destinations.

### Trip-Based Offline Maps

Offline maps now work differently to save space on your device:

- **Trip-based downloads** - Instead of downloading entire regions, you download maps for your specific trip
- **Automatic coverage** - When you download offline maps for a trip, all destinations in that trip are included automatically
- **Multi-destination support** - Even trips spanning multiple cities or countries download as a single package
- **Automatic cleanup** - Offline maps expire 30 days after your trip ends to free up space

### Cross-Platform Experience

Tripomatic 26 is built with modern technology that provides the same experience across all platforms:

- Same features on iOS, Android, and web
- Consistent design and navigation
- Real-time sync across all your devices
