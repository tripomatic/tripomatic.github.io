title: What's New in Tripomatic 26
---

Tripomatic 26 introduces several new features and improvements to help you plan and enjoy your trips.

### New Routing Modes

In addition to walking, car, and public transit, Tripomatic 26 now supports:

- **Bicycle** - Get cycling routes between places in your itinerary
- **Scooter** - Perfect for exploring cities with rental scooters
- **Taxi** - Plan routes when you prefer to take a cab

### Enhanced Public Transit

Public transit routing has been significantly improved:

- **Real schedules** - See actual departure and arrival times based on transit schedules
- **Detailed legs** - View each segment of your journey (walk to stop, take bus, transfer, etc.)
- **Line information** - See line numbers, colors, and names as used by local transit authorities
- **Platform numbers** - Know exactly where to catch your bus or train

To use public transit routing, you need to set a departure time for your journey. The app will then show you the best routes based on the actual transit schedules.

### Smarter Offline Maps

Offline maps now work differently to save space on your device:

- **Trip-based downloads** - Instead of downloading entire regions, you download maps for your specific trip
- **Automatic coverage** - When you download offline maps for a trip, all destinations in that trip are included automatically
- **Multi-destination support** - Even trips spanning multiple cities or countries download as a single package
- **Automatic cleanup** - Offline maps expire 30 days after your trip ends to free up space

### Cross-Platform Experience

Tripomatic 26 is built with modern technology that provides the same experience across all platforms:

- Same features on iOS, Android, and web
- Consistent design and navigation
- Real-time sync across all your devices
