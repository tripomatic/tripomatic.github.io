title: What Is the AI Assistant and How Do I Use It?
---

The AI assistant in Tripomatic 26 helps you plan your trips with intelligent suggestions and answers to your travel questions.

### What Can the AI Assistant Do?

- Help you discover places to visit
- Suggest activities based on your interests
- Answer questions about your destinations
- Help organize your itinerary

### Subscription Required

The AI assistant requires an active Tripomatic Premium subscription:

- **Monthly or yearly subscription** - Full access to the AI assistant and all premium features

If you have a lifetime Premium purchase from before Tripomatic 26, you'll need to upgrade to a subscription to access AI features. Your lifetime purchase continues to work for non-AI premium features, but AI capabilities require an active subscription.
