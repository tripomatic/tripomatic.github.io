The AI assistant in Tripomatic 26 helps you plan your trips with intelligent suggestions and answers to your travel questions.

### What Can the AI Assistant Do?

- Help you discover places to visit

- Answer questions about your destinations
- Help organize your itinerary

### Subscription Required

The AI assistant requires an active subscription to use:

- **Tripomatic Premium subscription** - Monthly, quarterly, or yearly subscribers have full access
