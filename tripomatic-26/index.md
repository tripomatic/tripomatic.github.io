### Migrating from the Previous Version

If you're coming from the previous version of Tripomatic (or Sygic Travel), your data will be automatically migrated when you sign in. Here's what you need to know:

- [Migration Guide]({% link tripomatic-26/migration-guide.md %}) - Step-by-step instructions for migrating your data
- [What's New]({% link tripomatic-26/whats-new.md %}) - Detailed overview of new features

### Important Notes

**Collaborators are not migrated.** If you shared trips with others in the previous version, you will need to re-invite them in Tripomatic 26. Your trips and their content will be migrated, but the sharing relationships will not.

**Changes don't sync back.** Once you migrate to Tripomatic 26, any changes you make will not sync back to the previous version. The migration copies your data, so both versions continue to work independently.
