Tripomatic 26 is a completely new generation of our travel planning app, rebuilt from the ground up. This new version brings a unified experience across all platforms while introducing powerful new features.

**Tripomatic 26 is currently in preview** and will be launched in late January / early February 2026. You can try the public preview now at [26.tripomatic.com](https://26.tripomatic.com).

### Migrating from the Previous Version

If you're coming from the previous version of Tripomatic, your data will be automatically transferred when you sign in. Here's what you need to know:

- [Migration Guide]({% link tripomatic-26/migration-guide.md %}) - Step-by-step instructions for migrating your data
- [What's New]({% link tripomatic-26/whats-new.md %}) - Detailed overview of new features
- [Feature Changes]({% link tripomatic-26/feature-changes.md %}) - How existing features work differently

### Important Notes

**Collaborators are not transferred.** If you shared trips with others in the previous version, you will need to re-invite them in Tripomatic 26. Your trips and their content will be transferred, but the sharing relationships will not.

**Changes don't sync back.** Once you move to Tripomatic 26, any changes you make will not sync back to the previous version. The migration copies your data, so both versions continue to work independently.
