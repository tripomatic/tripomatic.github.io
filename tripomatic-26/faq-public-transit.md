title: Why Isn't Public Transit Available in My Area?
---

Public transit routing depends on the availability of transit data. Tripomatic 26 uses HERE Technologies for public transit data.

### Coverage

HERE's public transit data covers:
- **1,900+ cities** in **65+ countries** worldwide
- Data from **2,800+ transit agencies** and sources
- Real-time schedule updates in **180+ cities**

Coverage includes most major cities in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other regions. However, smaller cities and some countries may not have transit data available.

### What Can I Do?

If public transit routing isn't available for your destination, you can use other routing options:

- **Walking** - For shorter distances
- **Car** - For driving routes
- **Bicycle** - For cycling routes
- **Taxi** - For taxi routes

Transit coverage is continuously expanding as more cities and transit agencies make their data available.
