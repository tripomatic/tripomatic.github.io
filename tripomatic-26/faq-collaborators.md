title: Why Can't I See My Collaborators?
---

Collaborators and sharing relationships are not transferred to Tripomatic 26. Your trips are transferred with all their content, but you need to re-invite anyone you previously shared trips with.

### How to Invite Collaborators Again

1. Open the trip you want to share
2. Go to Trip Menu (three dots icon above the dates)
3. Select Trip Sharing and click the Invite someone button
4. Fill in the travel companion's name (optional), select the permission level(view-only or full access) and click the Create Invite button.
5. Copy the link to the invite and share it with your travel companion.
6. They can click the link and join your trip.
