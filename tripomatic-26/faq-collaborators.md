title: Why Can't I See My Collaborators?
---

Collaborators and sharing relationships are not transferred to Tripomatic 26. Your trips are transferred with all their content, but you need to re-invite anyone you previously shared trips with.

### How to Invite Collaborators Again

1. Open the trip you want to share
2. Go to trip settings or the sharing menu
3. Invite your travel companions using their email address

They will receive an invitation and can join your trip once they accept it.
