title: Do My Custom Places Transfer?
---

Custom places that are part of your trips or favorites are transferred to Tripomatic 26.

Standalone custom places that aren't associated with any trip or favorites list are not transferred.

### What This Means

If you created a custom place and:
- **Added it to a trip** → It will transfer with that trip
- **Saved it to favorites** → It will transfer with your favorites
- **Left it standalone** → It will not transfer

To ensure your custom places are transferred, add them to a trip or save them to your favorites before migrating.
