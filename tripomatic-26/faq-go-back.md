title: Can I Go Back to the Old App?
---

Yes, the old app continues to work with your original data.

However, any changes you make in Tripomatic 26 will not sync back to the old version. The transfer copies your data, so both versions work independently.

If you prefer to continue using the old app, you can do so. Your data remains intact there.
