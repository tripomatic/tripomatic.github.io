title: Can I Go Back to the Old App?
---

The previous version of Tripomatic (the "old app") is still available for a limited time on the web at [legacy.tripomatic.com](https://legacy.tripomatic.com). You can also access it from a mobile browser on your phone or tablet.

### Important Limitations

**Changes do not sync back.** Any changes you make in the legacy version will not automatically sync to Tripomatic 26. The two versions operate independently.

**No reverse import.** There is no way to import data from Tripomatic 26 back to the legacy version.

If you made changes in the legacy version and want to bring them to Tripomatic 26, you will need to transfer the data manually using the [Migration Assistant]({% link tripomatic-26/faq-migration-assistant.md %}).
