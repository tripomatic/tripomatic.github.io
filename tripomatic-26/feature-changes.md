title: Feature Changes in Tripomatic 26
---

While most features work the same way in Tripomatic 26, some have changed. Here's what's different.

### Offline Maps

**Previous version:** You downloaded offline maps by selecting geographic regions or areas (e.g., "Paris" or "France").

**Tripomatic 26:** You download offline maps for your entire trip at once. When you tap the download button, the app automatically downloads maps for all destinations in your trip, regardless of how many cities or countries it spans.

**Additional changes:**
- Offline maps now expire **30 days after your trip ends** to save storage space
- Trips without an end date keep their offline maps indefinitely
- You can re-download offline maps anytime from the trip details

### Public Transit Routing

**Previous version:** Public transit routing showed general routes without specific schedules.

**Tripomatic 26:** Public transit routing is now schedule-based and requires you to set a departure time.

**Key differences:**
- You must specify when you want to depart
- Routes are based on actual transit schedules
- You'll see detailed information including line numbers, colors, and platform numbers
- Coverage depends on the availability of transit data in your location (powered by HERE Technologies)

### Trip Collaboration

**Previous version:** When you shared a trip, collaborators were saved with the trip.

**Tripomatic 26:** Collaboration still works the same way, but **collaborators are not migrated** from the previous version.

**What this means:**
- Your trips are migrated with all their content
- Sharing relationships are not migrated
- You need to re-invite collaborators after migrating

### Removed Features

The following features are no longer available in Tripomatic 26:

- **360-degree VR videos** - These are no longer included in the app
