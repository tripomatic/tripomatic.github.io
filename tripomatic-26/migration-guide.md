title: Migrating to Tripomatic 26
---

This guide explains how to migrate your data from the previous version of Tripomatic to Tripomatic 26.

### What Gets Migrated

When you migrate, the following data is transferred to Tripomatic 26:

- **Trips** - All your trips, including itineraries, activities, notes, and accommodations
- **Favorites** - Your saved places that appear highlighted on the map
- **User settings** - Your preferences and profile information

### What Does NOT Get Migrated

The following items are not included in the migration:

- **Collaborators and shared access** - You will need to re-invite anyone you previously shared trips with
- **Standalone custom places** - Custom places that are not part of any trip or favorites list

### How Migration Works

#### Automatic Migration

If you create a new Tripomatic 26 account, your data will be migrated automatically within 24 hours of signing up. Simply sign in with the same account you used before, and the migration will begin.

#### Manual Migration

You can also trigger migration manually at any time:

1. Open Tripomatic 26 and sign in
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Tap **Migration Assistant**
4. Choose what to migrate:
   - **Migrate my account** - Migrates everything (settings, favorites, and all trips)
   - **Migrate Favorites** - Migrates only your favorites
   - **Migrate New Trips** - Migrates only trips that haven't been migrated yet

### Selective Migration

The Migration Assistant allows you to migrate individual trips:

1. Open the Migration Assistant
2. You'll see a list of all your trips from the previous version
3. Trips with a checkmark have already been migrated
4. Tap the download icon next to any trip to migrate it individually

### Re-migrating Data

If you made changes in the old app and want to bring them over, you can re-migrate:

1. Open the Migration Assistant
2. Select the trip you want to re-migrate
3. The existing trip in Tripomatic 26 will be replaced with the fresh data

### Important Notes

**Data is copied, not moved.** The migration creates a copy of your data. Your old app continues to work with the original data, and the new app works with the copied data.

**No way to migrate back.** Changes made in Tripomatic 26 cannot be transferred back to the previous version.

**Re-invite your collaborators.** After migration, go to your shared trips and invite your travel companions again. They will need to accept the new invitation.
