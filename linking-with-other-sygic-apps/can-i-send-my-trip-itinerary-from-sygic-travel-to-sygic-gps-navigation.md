title: Can I send my trip itinerary from Sygic Travel to Sygic GPS Navigation?
---

Unfortunately, the two apps are not connected like this, but you can easily use Sygic GPS Navigation to navigate yourself.
To navigate yourself to a place from the Sygic Travel app, open the detail of the place and choose Navigate below the name of the place.
If you choose car navigation, you will be taken to a navigation app you have installed on your phone - for example Sygic. You can change which app this action opens [in the settings of the app](how-can-i-change-my-preferred-navigation-app-in-sygic-travel.html).
