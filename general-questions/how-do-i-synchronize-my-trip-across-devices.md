title: How do I synchronize my trip across devices?
---

If you're signed in with the same account on all your devices, your trips sync automatically in real-time. Any changes you make are immediately available on your other devices.

## Troubleshooting

If your trips aren't syncing:

1. **Check your internet connection** - Sync requires an active connection
2. **Verify your account** - Make sure you're signed in with the same account (Google, Apple, or email) on all devices
3. **Sign out and back in** - This can refresh the connection
4. **Reinstall the app** - If problems persist, try reinstalling

## How Sync Works

- Changes sync instantly when online
- When offline, changes are saved locally and sync when you reconnect
- The app shows a sync indicator when changes are being uploaded
