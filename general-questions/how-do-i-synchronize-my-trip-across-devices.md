title: How do I synchronize my trip across devices?
---

If you are signed in under the same account on all your devices, the latest version of all your trips is always available on them. Synchronisation is automatic and happens in the background.
**Troubleshooting**
If something's not right, please try the following:
Check that you're connected to the internet.
Check that you're using the correct account (Facebook, Google or email and password).
Check that your trip is not archived.
Swipe down from the main menu of the app, this will reinforce the synchronisation.
Log out and back into the app.
Reinstall the app.
