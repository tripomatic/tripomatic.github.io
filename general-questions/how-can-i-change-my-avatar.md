title: How can I change my avatar?
---

Your profile picture in Tripomatic comes from your sign-in method:

- **Google sign-in** - Your Google profile picture is used automatically
- **Apple sign-in** - Your Apple ID photo is used (if set)
- **Email/password** - You can use [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) to set a profile picture linked to your email address

To change your avatar, update your photo on the respective service (Google, Apple, or Gravatar) and it will sync to Tripomatic.
