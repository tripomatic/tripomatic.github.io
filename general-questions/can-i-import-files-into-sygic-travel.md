title: Can I import files into Sygic Travel?
---

We are sorry to disappoint you but importing files into Sygic Travel is not possible. We are not planning to add this feature in the near future.
You can only [export your itinerary to a KML or GPX file](../on-the-road/downloading-the-pdf-guide.html).
