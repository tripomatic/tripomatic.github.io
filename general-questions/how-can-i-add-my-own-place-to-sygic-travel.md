2. A tooltip appears with the address (if available)
3. Tap **Add to trip** or **Add to Shortlist**
4. Edit the name and add details as needed

## On Desktop/Web

1. Click anywhere on the map, or search for an address or GPS coordinates (e.g., `49.232883, 16.572891`)
2. Click **Add to trip** or **Add to Shortlist**
3. Edit the custom place name and details

## Editing Custom Places

After creating a custom place, you can edit it to add:
