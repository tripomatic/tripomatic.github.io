## Transportation

### Public Transit
Germany's public transit system is extensive and reliable, covering buses, trams, U-Bahn (subway), and S-Bahn (suburban trains). Major cities like Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg have comprehensive networks. A single ticket can often be used across different modes of transport within the same city. Costs vary by city but are generally affordable, with options for daily, weekly, or monthly passes. The system is considered safe to use at all hours.

### Taxis
Taxis are reliable and can be hailed on the street or ordered via phone or app. They are metered, with initial charges around €3.50-€4.00 and about €2.00 per kilometer thereafter. Taxis are safe, but more expensive compared to public transportation.

### Driving
Driving in Germany is on the right-hand side. The country is famous for its Autobahn, where many sections have no speed limit. However, the recommended speed is 130 km/h (about 81 mph). Alcohol limit is 0.05% BAC. An International Driving Permit is recommended for non-EU drivers.

## Attractions and Shopping
Shops typically open from 10 am to 8 pm, Monday to Saturday. Sunday shopping is rare except for certain Sundays declared open by cities. Museums are usually closed on Mondays. Lunch is typically from 12 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 6 pm to 8 pm. Some restaurants may close in the afternoon.

Tipping is customary in Germany, with a usual 5-10% of the bill in restaurants, rounded up to the nearest euro for taxis. It's not required but appreciated for good service.
