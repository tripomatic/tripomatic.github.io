title: How does shared planning work?
---

Share your trips with travel companions so everyone can view and edit the itinerary together.

## How to Invite Someone

1. Open your trip
2. Go to **Trip Settings** > **Sharing** (or tap the share icon)
3. Tap **Invite someone**
4. A shareable invite link is created
5. Share the link via messaging apps, email, or copy to clipboard

## Invite Details

- Invite links are **valid for 14 days**
- Each link can be used **once**
- You can create multiple invites for different people

## Permission Levels

When someone accepts your invite, you can set their permission:
- **Can edit** - They can add, remove, and modify activities
- **View only** - They can see the trip but not make changes

## Managing Collaborators

In the Sharing panel, you'll see:
- **Shared With** - People who have accepted invites (with their permission level)
- **Pending Invites** - Links that haven't been used yet

You can:
- Change someone's permission level
- Remove a collaborator
- Cancel pending invites

## Real-time Sync

All changes sync immediately across all collaborators. When someone adds or moves an activity, everyone sees the update right away.
