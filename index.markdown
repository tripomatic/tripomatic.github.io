**SYGIC TRAVEL IS NOW TRIPOMATIC**
<br />
<br />
As of November 11, 2024, Sygic Travel has embarked on a new journey as **Tripomatic**, stepping away from our affiliation with Sygic a.s.
<br />
<br />
This change marks the beginning of an exciting era. We're dedicated to maintaining the high-quality service you've come to expect from us, and we're gearing up to introduce significant enhancements and new features to our apps.
<br />
<br />
**What is new**
<br />
<br />
The Sygic Travel app on your phone will automatically update with the name <strong>Tripomatic</strong> and a new icon. The web planner moves to a new home at <a href="https://maps.tripomatic.com">https://maps.tripomatic.com</a>.
