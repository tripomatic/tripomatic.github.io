title: Migrating from Sign in with Facebook to Tripomatic Account
---

The Tripomatic mobile and web apps no longer support Sign in with Facebook. If you previously signed in with Facebook, you'll need to migrate your account using the Customer Portal.

**Important:** Facebook sign-in is only available on the [Customer Portal](https://customer.tripomatic.com) for migration purposes. After migrating, you'll use Google, Apple, or email/password to sign in to the Tripomatic apps.

## How to Migrate Your Account

1. Open the [Migration Assistant](https://customer.tripomatic.com/migrate) in your web browser.
2. Create a new Tripomatic account using Google, Apple, or email/password.
3. Click "Sign in with Facebook" to connect your old account. This will transfer your trips and data to the new account.
4. You can now sign in to Tripomatic mobile and web apps with your new account.

You will receive an email confirming the migration.
