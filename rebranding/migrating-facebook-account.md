Tripomatic accounts no longer support Sign in with Facebook. If you previously signed in with Facebook, youâ€™ll need to manually migrate your account.

## How to Migrate Your Account

1. Open the [Migration Assistant](https://customer.tripomatic.com/migrate).
2. Create a new Tripomatic account. You can use one-click sign-in with Apple or Google, or create a traditional account with your email and password.
3. Sign in with your Facebook account. This will associate your data with the new account and complete the migration.
4. You can now sign in to Tripomatic mobile and web apps with your new Tripomatic account and access your data.
