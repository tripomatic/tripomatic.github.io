About migrating your account from Sygic Travel to Tripomatic.

## I cannot sign in on Android / iOS / web

1. Check that the mobile app is up to date. It should be named "**Tripomatic**" and have a new icon. Update the app manually by going to Google Play or the App Store if it isn't updated automatically.
2. Make sure you are using the correct email address and password. If you use multiple emails, search your inbox for past emails from Sygic Travel to find the one you used to sign in.
3. Try [resetting your password](https://customer.tripomatic.com/reset-password).
4. Try signing in with Google or Apple.

## I cannot see (all of) my past trips

The following reasons might explain why you cannot see your past trips:

#### Trips take time to load
It may take a few minutes to load your trips on mobile devices after signing in. Ensure you have a stable internet connection. If the problem persists, check the troubleshooting section below.

#### You signed in with a different identity provider
If, for example, you previously signed in with Google but signed in with Apple this time, the accounts may not be merged. Try signing in with the same identity provider (or email/password) you previously used.

#### You may have multiple accounts
Are you sure you signed in with the correct account? If you have multiple accounts (emails), sign in again with each account to migrate your data. Trips and favorites are associated with specific accounts, so you will only see the trips and favorites linked to the account that is currently signed in.

## Troubleshooting

1. Check that you received an *"Account migrated"* email from us (sender: team@mail.tripomatic.com). If not, you likely have not migrated your Sygic Travel account yet. Refer to [How to migrate from Sygic Travel to Tripomatic]({% link rebranding/migrate-sygic-travel-account.md %}).
2. Verify that you can sign in at [maps.tripomatic.com](https://maps.tripomatic.com) and check if your past trips are visible. If not, you may have used a different account or identity provider. Try signing in with other emails you use or with Google/Apple.
3. Check that you can sign in to the Customer Portal at [customer.tripomatic.com](https://customer.tripomatic.com).
4. Attempt to migrate your account manually by following the steps at [Migration Assistant](https://customer.tripomatic.com/migrate-all).
