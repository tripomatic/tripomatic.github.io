title: Migrating Your Sygic Travel Account to Tripomatic
---

On November 11, 2024, Sygic Travel mobile and web apps rebranded to Tripomatic and separated from the Sygic brand. If you have an existing Sygic Travel account, you will need to sign in again to access your data.

## Why Do I Have to Sign In Again?

Sygic Travel used a Sygic account for sign-ins. As we transition away from the Sygic brand, we need to create a new Tripomatic account for you.

In most cases, simply signing in again will take care of the process and restore access to your data.

## If You Signed In with Facebook

If you previously signed in with Facebook, you’ll need to migrate your account manually. Follow these three easy steps using our [Migration Assistant](https://customer.tripomatic.com/migrate):

1. First, create a new Tripomatic account. You can use one-click sign-in with Apple or Google or create a traditional account with your email and password.
2. Next, sign in with your Facebook account. This will associate your data with the new account and complete the migration.
3. You can now sign in with your new Tripomatic account and access your data.

## What Happens to My Sygic Account?

Your Sygic account will be unaffected and will continue to work with Sygic apps. 

## When Do I Need to Migrate My Account?

You must migrate your account **by December 15, 2024**. After this date, we cannot guarantee access to trips and other data created with the Sygic account.

## What If I Don’t Migrate My Account?

If you don’t migrate, you may lose access to your trips, favorites, and other data created before the migration.

## What Happens to My Sygic Travel Premium?

All purchases remain valid and are not affected by the account migration. Sygic Travel Premium has been renamed to Tripomatic Premium and will continue to work as usual.

## Where do I change my e-mail or password?

After your Tripomatic account is created, you manage your account settings on the [Customer portal](https://customer.tripomatic.com/).
