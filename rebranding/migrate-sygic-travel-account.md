title: Why Do I Need to Sign In Again?
---

On November 11, 2024, Sygic Travel mobile and web apps rebranded to Tripomatic and separated from the Sygic brand. If you have an existing Sygic Travel account, you will need to sign in again to migrate your account and access your data.

Sygic Travel used a Sygic account for sign-ins. As we transition away from the Sygic brand, we need to create a new **Tripomatic** account for you. 

In most cases, simply signing in again will complete the process and restore access to your data. After signing in, you will receive an email confirming the migration. You don't need to do anything else.

### If You Signed In with Facebook

If you previously signed in with Facebook, you’ll need to migrate your account manually. To proceed, follow three easy steps using our [Migration Assistant](https://customer.tripomatic.com/migrate). For more details, see [Migrating from Sign in with Facebook]({% link rebranding/migrating-facebook-account.md %}).

### What Happens to My Sygic Account?

Your Sygic account will remain unaffected and will continue to work with Sygic apps. 

### What If I Don't Migrate My Account?

If you don't migrate, you won't be able to access your trips, favorites, and other data created with your Sygic Travel account. We recommend migrating as soon as possible to ensure continued access to your data.

### What Happens to My Sygic Travel Premium?

All purchases remain valid and are not affected by the account migration. Sygic Travel Premium has been renamed to **Tripomatic Premium** and will continue to work as usual.

### Where Do I Change My E-mail or Password?

After your Tripomatic account is created, you can manage your account settings in the [Customer Portal](https://customer.tripomatic.com/).
