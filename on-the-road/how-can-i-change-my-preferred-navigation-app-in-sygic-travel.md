# iOS app 

If you want to change the default navigation app, go to your phone settings, open Tripomatic and go to Navigation App. Then, choose whichever app from the list you prefer to use. 

# Android app 

Once you tap on "Navigate" in the detail of a place, you will get to select which of the navigation apps installed on your device you would like to use.
