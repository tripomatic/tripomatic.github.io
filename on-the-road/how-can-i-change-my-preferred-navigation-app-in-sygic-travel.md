When you tap **Navigate** or **Open in map app**, Tripomatic shows you a list of available navigation apps installed on your device.

## How It Works

1. Tap **Navigate** on any place or transit route
2. A dialog appears with all compatible map apps on your device
3. Select the app you want to use
4. The app opens with directions to your destination

## Supported Navigation Apps

Tripomatic can open directions in:
- Apple Maps (iOS)
- Google Maps
- Waze
- Sygic GPS Navigation
- HERE WeGo
- And other navigation apps installed on your device

The app automatically detects which navigation apps you have installed and shows them as options.
