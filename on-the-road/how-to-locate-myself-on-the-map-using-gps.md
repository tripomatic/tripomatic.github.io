title: How to locate myself on the map using GPS?
---

Tripomatic can show your current location on the map using your device's GPS.

## Enabling Location

1. Make sure location services are enabled in your device settings
2. Grant Tripomatic permission to access your location when prompted

## Finding Your Location

Tap the **location button** on the map (usually shown as a target or arrow icon on the side of the screen). The map will center on your current position and show a blue dot indicating where you are.

## Location Modes

Tap the location button multiple times to cycle through modes:
1. **Center on location** - Shows your position once
2. **Follow location** - Map stays centered as you move
3. **Compass mode** - Map rotates to match your heading

## Troubleshooting

If your location isn't showing:
- Check that location services are enabled in device settings
- Make sure Tripomatic has location permission
- Try moving to an area with better GPS signal (outdoors works best)
