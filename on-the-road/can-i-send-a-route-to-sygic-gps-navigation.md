Please note that the route and the estimated arrival time (ETA) might be a little different in the app. This is caused by the fact that the navigation app uses [Predictive Routing](http://www.sygic.com/blog/2018/faster-route-calculation-with-predictive-routing) which considers historical traffic data to calculate the most efficient route.
